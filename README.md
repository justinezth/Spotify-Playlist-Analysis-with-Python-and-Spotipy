# Spotify-Playlist-Analysis-with-Python-and-Spotipy
Using Python and Spotify's API, I created an analysis/comparison of my favorite English songs and Chinese songs. I wanted to compare a set of my favorite English songs and Chinese songs because due to COVID-19, I've been staying in Taipei this semester (instead of Los Angeles, where I go to school), which has gotten me to start listening to more songs in Chinese. I thought it would be fun to do an analysis of these Chinese songs I've started listening to and compare it to the English songs I like.

## Goal
To see if my taste in music is similar in different languages, and to get to know my music taste a little better through numbers and visualizations.

## Data Collection + Resources Used
I used [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.13.0/), a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. With Spotipy, I get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform. 

I looked at [makispl's repository](https://github.com/makispl/Spotify-Data-Analysis) to help write the Authorization Flow code to gain access to Spotify's data.

I was also inspired by [jmcabreira's repo](https://github.com/jmcabreira) for this project.
